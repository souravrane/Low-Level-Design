## Node Class Requirements

Create a `Node` class with the following specifications:

### Data Members

- `data`: an integer representing the data stored in the node.
- `next`: a reference to the next `Node` in the sequence.

### Constructors

- A public constructor that takes an integer and sets the `data` field.
- A public constructor that takes an integer and a `Node`, setting both the `data` and `next` fields.

### Additional Requirements

Implement the necessary classes and interfaces to enable the `Node` class to be iterable, allowing for the use of a for-each loop over instances of the `Node` class.
