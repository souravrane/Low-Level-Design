**call** vs **new** in Singleton Implementations

üß© Purpose

Both methods control object creation, but at different levels of Python‚Äôs class system.

‚∏ª

‚öôÔ∏è **new** ‚Äî Instance Creation Hook (Class Level)
‚Ä¢ Where it lives: Inside a class or base class.
‚Ä¢ When it runs: Before **init**, whenever you do MyClass().
‚Ä¢ What it does: Allocates and returns a new instance object.
‚Ä¢ Why used in Singleton:
Checks if an instance already exists; if not, creates one and stores it.
Subsequent calls return the cached object.

Example

class SingletonBase:
\_instance = None
def **new**(cls, \*args, \*\*kwargs):
if cls.\_instance is None:
cls.\_instance = super().**new**(cls)
return cls.\_instance

‚∏ª

üß† **call** ‚Äî Class Instantiation Hook (Metaclass Level)
‚Ä¢ Where it lives: Inside a metaclass.
‚Ä¢ When it runs: Every time you ‚Äúcall‚Äù a class (e.g. MyClass()), before Python allocates the instance.
‚Ä¢ What it does: Wraps the entire creation process (**new** ‚Üí **init**).
‚Ä¢ Why used in Singleton:
Lets you intercept instantiation globally so any class using that metaclass becomes a singleton automatically‚Äîno need for a shared base class.

Example

class SingletonMeta(type):
\_instances = {}
def **call**(cls, *args, \*\*kwargs):
if cls not in cls.\_instances:
cls.\_instances[cls] = super().**call**(*args, \*\*kwargs)
return cls.\_instances[cls]

üîç Summary

Aspect **new** **call**
Belongs to Class Metaclass
Controls Instance creation Class instantiation process
Runs when MyClass() is invoked MyClass() is invoked (but before **new**)
Scope Per class Affects all classes using that metaclass
Use case Simple or few singletons (via base class) Framework-level or multiple singletons
Analogy Factory method inside a class Factory method for classes themselves

‚∏ª

‚úÖ In short:
‚Ä¢ Use **new** when you just want one class (or a few) to be singletons.
‚Ä¢ Use **call** in a metaclass when you want any class with that metaclass to automatically enforce singleton behavior.
