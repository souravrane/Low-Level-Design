# Adder-Subtractor Class with Multithreading

## Problem Statement

Create an `AdderSubtractor` class that includes two main components:

1. **Adder**: This component will add a number to a shared variable.
2. **Subtractor**: This component will subtract a number from the shared variable.

These operations should be executed in parallel using multithreading. The goal is to ensure that the output of the process remains consistent and does not vary, thereby achieving synchronization.
